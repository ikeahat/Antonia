The program "Antonia" lets clubs manage their finances with ease and features three distinct and versatile roles the guarantee clear permissions for each officer, so that the money is safe, and the transaction history stored  securely.

The program is divided into two files. 

    A backend that handles the storing of the users data, and the rest of the usual backend stuff, whereas the GUI makes use of Pythons integrated Tkinter module to set up the different windows that allow each role to handle their tasks.


The following are the available roles:
     
ADMIN:
    
    When starting up the program, the user will get pre-made login data for an ADMIN account.
    This account may be deleted or edited afterwards.
